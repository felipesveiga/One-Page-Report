# One-Page-Report
A Task Automation project with Python regarding file manipulation and sending of emails.

I've pretended to be a clothing brand Data Analysis employee.  The company has multiple stores across the Brazilian territory.
The tasks to be carried out were the creation of daily and annual One Page reports over the selling performance from each of the vendors.

Additionally, it was also demanded that we made a daily and annual ranking on the revenue earned by the stores.

The documents needed to be send via e-mail to the shops' managers and the enterprise's leadership.
